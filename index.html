				<h3>History of the Web</h3>
				<p class="post_info">Corey Ptaszek, 09/12/2020<p>
				<p class="post"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> created HTML while working for CERN in the late 80's and early 90's. He originally envisioned it as a way to share and link scientific papers for easy reference, but it eventually grew into the backbone of all webpages on the World Wide Web. HTML was originally completely text-based, but modern HTML5 can now natively handle audio and video files. These days the development of the HTML standard is overseen by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with support from the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>

				<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
				<p class="post_info">Corey Ptaszek, 09/12/2020<p>
				<p class="post">Hyperlinks are a feature of HTML that connect different HTML documents, files, and other objects together allowing quick navigation between them. Hyperlinks were central to the original intention of HTML: Linking scientific papers together for easy navigation and reference. Hyperlinks are created using the HTML "&lt;a&gt;" tag. This tag is two-sided and is always accompanied by the "href" attribute that tells it what to link to. Text placed between the opening and closing tag will be displayed as the text of the link. Alternatively, you can create a hyperlink out of an image by wrapping the &lt;img&gt; tag in the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>
