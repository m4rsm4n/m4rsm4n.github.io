			<h2>Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Corey Ptaszek and I am a Software Engineering major. I'm pursuing this major because I've always had a love for computers and I want to understand them and their software more. After my graduation my goal is to begin with a job nearby developing software, hopefully with a company in Pittsburgh or with the FBI at their complex in Clarksburg.</p>
		
			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>My biggest hobby is gaming. Whether it's retro (actual hardware or emulation), PC, or console I just love video games. My favorite games are story heavy adventure games and racing games. I have a racing wheel and peddles I use to play a few racing simulators, namely Forza Motorsport 7, Gran Turismo Sport, and Assetto Corsa.</p>
			<p>I also like to read Fantasy, History, and Sci-Fi books. I'm currently reading through the Witcher novels and Battlecry of Freedom, an account of the American Civil War.</p>

				<li>Custom PC</li>
				<li>MacBook Pro, 13in</li>
